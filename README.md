# FT_TRANSCENDENCE

[Live demo](http://lost-in-transcendence.duckdns.org) (must be a 42 student to login, but you can also log in as a guest)

## To setup

Clone the repo, then simply run:
```
docker compose up --build
```
... in the root of the repository.
A .env file is required, you can probably figure most things out by looking at the docker-compose.yml file.


## What is this?

This is the final assignment for 42 School of Code's Common Core, ft_transcendence.
A React and NestJS-based full-stack app written in Typescript featuring...

  - An online, customizable Pong game
  - A live chat interface, complete with channel creation and administration
  - User profiles, friendlists, blacklists...
  - Live rankings and a leaderboard
  - And a bunch of other stuff!
 
If you're a fellow 42 student using a similar stack and you want some advice, feel free to hit us up!
